Shopping List Webpage (Work in progress)
- 
Created using React JS.
A single page application that displays a variety of grocery items under their respective categories.
User can add items to a shopping list that is displayed at the bottom of the page.
Items in the shopping list can be removed from the list, and the user can change the number of units/ items to purchase, which will re-render the respective item with the updated information.

A list of things for future me to do/add (in no particular order + subject to change):
- 
Make list items under Item Categories a link that takes you to the respective category on the webpage.
Update each item's unit price in itemsData.js. Calculate the total cost of all items in the shoppingList and display it at the bottom on the webpage.
